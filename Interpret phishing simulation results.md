The percentages shown are based off the total number of staff members who received the email. 

For example if 100 people received the email and 50 people opened it - the email open rate would be 50%.

Email open rate = the percentage of people that opened it
Email click-through rate = the percentage of people that clicked on the link
Phishing success rate = the percentage of people that clicked the link and inputted some personal information
