## **Task 1: Design a phishing email simulation**

Improve the phishing email

Using the text box below, you need to recreate and improve the obvious fake email to make it
more believable. Remember the end goal is to encourage the user to click on the link.
To create a 'good' phishing email, you should:
. Add some context at the beginning - make it relevant to a Mastercard employee
. Mask the hyperlink within text
. Use correct spelling and grammar
. Add points of legitimacy
Once you've submitted your email, we'll show you an example of a good phishing email.
Here is the obvious fake:

> # **From: mastercardsIT@gmail.com**

> To: employee@email.com

> Subject: URGENT! Password Reset Required-

> Body:

> Hello (insert name) ,
> Your email account has been compromised. immediate action is required to reset
> your password!
> Click here to reset your password in the next hour or your account will be lock

### 🧠 Analysis

| Element                        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Urgency/Threat**            | "Immediate action required" and "24-hour deadline" creates pressure to act. |
| **Authority**                 | Appears to come from a trusted internal source (IT Security).              |
| **Action Link**               | Prompts user to click on a link — potential credential phishing attempt.    |
| **Generic Greeting**          | Uses `[Employee Name]` instead of a real name (can be a red flag).         |
| **Spoofed Email Address**     | Looks like a legitimate address but could be faked or masked.              |

### ✅ Recommendation

Never click on suspicious links or respond to emails urging immediate action. Always verify the sender's identity through official channels and report suspected phishing emails to your security team.
